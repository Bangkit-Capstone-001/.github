# About
Based on data from Statista, the trend of public interest in healthy lifestyles such as food and sport is increasing. This has also led to an increase in the number of downloads of digital fitness and wellbeing apps by 9.9% per year. In addition, other data from the Populix Survey which claims that as many as 64% of Indonesians choose healthy catering services to maintain their calorie intake. However, healthy catering and gym services are still relatively expensive and only reaches a certain group of people. Therefore, we formulated a way on how the most simple and affordable way for people to fulfil a healthy lifestyle both from food and exercise. `FitFirst` comes as a personal diet assistant mobile application with workout plan, diet plan, calories analysis, and tracker for workout and diet goals. FitFirst simplifies the process for users aiming to achieve goals such as weight loss or targeted body training. Additionally, FitFirst provides detailed calorie information for foods entered by users. Our goal is to help users easily adopt a healthy lifestyle through proper nutrition and exercise.
